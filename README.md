New Relic Synthetics<br>formatter for Selenium-builder
==============================

Plugin (formatter) for Se-builder that generates javascript from Se-builder scripts to use in New Relic Synthetics Scripted Browser tests.

## IMPORTANT - Katalon Recorder - A better alternative for recording NR Synthetics scripts!

There is now a New Relic Synthetics exporter built-in to Katalon Recorder, an actively-updated IDE for synthetic testing.
* Install Katalon Recorder from the Chrome Web Store (**no extensions needed!**): https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/katalon-recorder/ljdobmomdgdljniojadhoplhkpialdid
* GitHub repo: https://github.com/katalon-studio/katalon-recorder/

## IMPORTANT - Version Compatibility

### Selenium Builder 3 Compatibility Update

<b>I have tested the plugin with the new version of se-builder and it works fine!</b> You can use that version if you want, installed from here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/selenium-builder/

The only change in the installation is the location of the plugin. It is now placed in `SeBuilder3/plugins` instead of `SeBuilder/plugins`. Can't find the plugins directory? [Check here!](#cant-find-the-plugins-directory)

<b>Limitation of Selenium Builder 3: local playback does not work.</b> If you want to record a script and replay it after tweaking, you'll need to run a Selenium Server somewhere. [That's easy enough to do.](http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/05_selenium_rc.jsp#installation) It can be run locally on your laptop.

### Selenium Builder 2 (aka Se-Builder) Compatibility

This formatter plugin is tested and compatible with the old version of Se-Builder, which is an unisgned plugin. <b>The old version of Se-Builder no longer runs in Firefox by default. See https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-signing-in-firefox for a workaround.</b> NOTE: This workaround may not work for the most recent versions of Firefox. If that's the case, either use an older version of Firefox, or use Selenium Builder 3 (now that the plugin supports it).

* Old version: Se-Builder 2: https://github.com/SeleniumBuilder/se-builder/
	* Download: http://www.saucelabs.com/addons/selenium-builder-latest.xpi
* New version: Selenium Builder 3: https://github.com/SeleniumBuilder/selenium-builder/
    * Download: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/selenium-builder/

## Installation

### Download the plugin: [Download link](https://github.com/sschwartzman/newrelic-synthetics-sebuilder/raw/master/nr_synthetics_formatter.zip)

### Install the prerequisites

1. Download & install either Se-builder v2 or v3:
   * [Firefox ESR 52](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/52.9.0esr/) or the last pre-quantum release, [Firefox 56](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/56.0.2/). **Selenium Builder is currently not compatible with Firefox Quantum (Firefox 57+)**
   * [Se-builder 2](http://www.saucelabs.com/addons/selenium-builder-latest.xpi).
   * [Selenium Builder 3](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/selenium-builder/)
2. Run Se-builder at least once before proceeding. Running it the first time creates the folder where you'll put the plugin. Run it by going to <b>Tools > Web Developer > Launch Selenium Builder.</b>

### Install the plugin

1. If you haven't already, [Download the plugin!](https://github.com/sschwartzman/newrelic-synthetics-sebuilder/raw/master/nr_synthetics_formatter.zip)
2. Unzip the plugin into the `SeBuilder/plugins` (v2) or `SeBuilder3/plugins` (v3) directory on in your Firefox profile. Your folder structure should look like this: ![Img of folder structure](https://github.com/sschwartzman/newrelic-synthetics-sebuilder/blob/master/etc/folder_structure.png)
   * Can't find the Se-builder plugins directory? [Check here](#cant-find-the-plugins-directory)
3. Restart the se-builder if you still have it running. You don't have to restart Firefox, just exit and re-open Se-builder.
4. To verify that the plugin is loaded, click "Manage plugins" in the opening dialog box. You should see "New Relic Synthetics Formatter #.#  Installed" in the Plugins list.
   * *If the Manage Plugins page throws an error, don't fret!* This may be a issue with se-builder that doesn't impact the plugin. If it does happen, try recording a simple script and exporting it. If you see "New Relic Synthetics (WebDriverJS)" in the File -> Export dialog, the plugin is working properly.
   * If it didn't load, try restarting Firefox entirely and then re-running Se-builder.
   
## Using the formatter

1. Write, record or open a test. 
   * Be sure to create in "Selenium 2" format, or convert your existing script to it.
   * Check out the [Se-builder Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/sebuilder/se-builder/wiki/Getting-Started#recording-your-first-script) for more details on creating/recording scripts.
2. Export your test to Synthetics format
   * Once you have a script ready to export, in the menu bar, click File --> Export...
   * Click "New Relic Synthetics (WebDriverJS)"
   * Save the result to any name and location you want, so long as you can find it! 
   * When saving, add ".js" to the end of the file name so that it looks pretty in your text editor of choice.
3. Create a new Scripted Browser monitor in Synthetics
   * Click "Add New Monitor" in the main screen of Synthetics or visit 
   https://synthetics.newrelic.com/accounts/[your_account_id]/monitors/new
   * Choose "Scripted Browser" as the monitor type, and then set the name, locations & frequency as you like.
   * In the "Script your steps" window, clear the contents there and paste the contents of your exported script.
   * Be sure to click "Validate" below this window pane to ensure that the script works properly.

## Having issues?

* Please submit an issue to this github repo by clicking the "Issues" link on the right-hand menu and then click "New Issue"
* Please cut-and-paste the following detail into the issue:
  * Your original script created in se-builder - either in HTML or JSON format
  * The exported javascript file you pasted into Synthetics
  * The error messages and logs returned when you ran/validated your script
* *Please be patient!* Unfortunately, maintaining this script is not my day job, but I will get to your issue as soon as I can.
